The art assets of this game are 100% stolen. I make no claim of the legality of
their distribution, and will in fact claim quite plainly to the contrary. This
game is a parody of bootleg games—and, in fact, a bootleg game—so the stolen
art assets is a necessary part of the parody. It would be perfectly possible to
use the engine with original, legal art assets.


This code is under broad F/OSS licenses. However, as the F/OSS community in
general is pretty awful at understanding their own licenses, I want to make one
fact very clear: It is a violation of the license terms to remove license text
from the source OR BINARY. The actual runnable game must include license text;
in the normal build, this text is available by pressing select at the title
screen, but it may be moved elsewhere so long as it's accessible.


Most of this code, including any code lacking a license header, is under the
ISC license:

This code requires the cc65 compiler and libraries, and includes some cc65
initialization code. Those components are under the following license:

I have explicitly added the license text to source files where applicable to
clarify which components come from cc65.
